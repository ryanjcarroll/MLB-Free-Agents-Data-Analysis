Data Analysis of MLB Free Agent Contracts

* Web scraped all MLB free agent contract signings (2006-2019) from tables on ESPN.com, using BeautifulSoup and JSON.
* Used Pandas to clean the scraped data, ignoring certain types of low-value data such as minor league signings and retirements. Also converted several scraped values from formatted strings to integers.
* Generated visualizations of how contract sizes vary by player age and the year they were signed.
